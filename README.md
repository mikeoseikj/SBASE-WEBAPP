# SBASE-WEBAPP
This my first shot a web development by buildng a students examination results management system in about 2weeks. I designed it with Ghana's FREE SHS double track system in mind. Regardless of it specifics, it can also work for various educational structures that are not under the double track system in various countries. Check the INFO.txt file in this repository for more information about usage and structure.
[IT WAS WRITTEN FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES SO I DONT RECOMMEND IT FOR REAL USE WITHOUT SOME DRASTIC MODIFICATIONS TO SOLVE SOME SECURITY ISSUES AND DESIGN PROBLEMS] 

Note: Check INFO.txt for more information.
