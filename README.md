# SBASE-WEBAPP
Students examination results management system is a 2 weeks project I built that is specifically designed with Ghana's FREE SHS double track system in mind. 
Regardless of it specifics, it can also work for various educational structures that are not under the double track system in various countries. Check the INFO.txt file in this repository for more information about usage and structure.

Note: there is a folder named 'screenshot' in the webapp folder that contains images to give you a fair view of how the SBASE user interface looks like.
