Students examination results management system is a 2 weeks project I built in the first semester of year one that is specifically designed with Ghana's FREE SHS double track system in mind. 
Regardless of it specifics, it can also work for various educational structures that are not under the double track system in various countries. Check the INFO.txt file in this repository for more information about usage and structure.
[IT WAS WRITTEN FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES SO I DONT RECOMMEND IT FOR REAL USE WITHOUT SOME DRASTIC MODIFICATIONS TO SOLVE SOME SECURITY ISSUES AND DESIGN PROBLEMS] 

Note: Check INFO.txt for more information.
