[THIS SOFTWARE IS A WEB BASED STUDENT RESULTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT COMES WITH WEB LOGIN SESSIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR ,STUDENTS AND TUTORS. STUDENT CAN ALSO USE THE ADDED ANDROID APP TO CHECK THEIR RESULTS] 

NOTE: Software is for educational purposes but it can be used for real scenarios. 
No 'third party' dependencies! Built to be compatible on systems with low specs.

 I am neither a mobile application developer nor web developer so portions of my code and methods might look unprofessional or inefficient. I am open for constructive criticisms and advice. Free to use the project (for non commercial purposes only). Do well to acknowledge author when using software.



Requirements: php webserver and mysql server 

---[Setting up software]---
Get php and mysql server and run app with them. Thats all
Default sql server username ==> root ;password ==> ""; (go to the 'create_tables.php', admin and user 'sec' files,'connection.php' files in both the webapp and android login folder to change this for security reasons')


Admin username => admin (not case sensitive)
First time Admin password ==> 31337 (change this password in the 'login.php' for security reasons)
Admin permanent password must be between 16 to 32 characters

After setting permanent password you would be logged out and you have to log in with your new password to access account

After logging in as admin you can start configurations (easy)
User account permanent passwords must be 8 to 25 characters

Change ip address(192.168.43.127) in the SBASE android app to the ip address of your choice




------ABOUT SBASE-------
It is a student examination results management system built hopefully to make the lives of school IT administrators work easier (no technical skills is required to use software).
Built specifically for Ghana's SHS's (High schools) double and non-double track system.It will work for other educational levels and structures in Ghana and in other countries.



-----STRUCTURE-----
Made up of about 15 database tables (check 'create_tables.php' in the login folder)
the backend file a the ones with extended filenames  
eg. frontend =>sec.php
    backend =>secreg.php sometimes might be (sec_reg.php)

----Below is a graphical structural representation of the database----

forms --> track --> department --> class
               _________
               | FORM 1|   ==> FORM 2 ==> FORM 3 ==> FORM4                                                     
               |_______|

------CONFIGURATION PANEL--------

First time login for admin:
Administrator: username: [admin]
               passowrd: [31337]  go to the login.php file and change this password for security reasons

-The credentials above is for first time logins. After login with these, the administrator is forced to set a 16-32 character password
This also applies for the tutor and student sections (8-25 characters).

Admin adds users and a pseudo random permanent and unique username and a random first time login password is generated. 
Username length is 14 for teachers and 12 for students.

--------USERS------
Admin is the one supposed to add students and tutors and after that, the  distribution of credentials
Note: Both tutors and students are classified as "users"

------ADMIN FUNCTIONS----
-addition of configuration info via the side slide dialog in the configuration panel(forms, tracks,exam etc)
-configuration info deletion
-addition of user(s)
-deletion of user(s)
-updating of user(s) data
-activation and deactivation of accounts (CRED button)
-activation and deactivation of specific users allowed  (update button)
-distribution of credentials (CRED button)
-numerical view of database structure (click STATISTICS button)

----TUTOR (USER) FUNCTIONS----
-input marks for students
-view position of students based on subject the tutor has access to

----STUDENT (USER) FUNCTIONS------
-view latest and old results (like a transcript)
-graphical view of transcript

---GENERAL FUNCTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATOR AND USERS-----
-password reset
-password change/recover via hint

Note: if password and hint is lost then your account cannot be recovered though Admin can use 'unconventional' methods to recover account



-----INTERNAL WORKINGS--------
-Some functions can be performed for a group of users at a time
-Deleting a student or tutor will all info related to user.
-Updating a tutor means increasing tutor access level (adding a new subject)
-Updating  student(s) info delete(s) all previous subject(s) and set the newly added ones .Meaning you have to re-select old/current subject(s) when updating users or else you will lose all unselected subject info relating to user(s)
-latest added exam becomes active. if deleted it will shift to the previous one (based on PRIMARY KEY(id))
-admin has no functional influence over results and there is not functionality provided for admin to insert marks
-computation of marks is automated.
-deadlines for tutors to record marks has to be done phyiscally through the block of all tutor accounts. (single button provided)
-students can  be block from viewing marks 
-a single user account can be deactivated or activated
-students are logged out of their accounts after 5 minutes
-tutors are logged out of their accounts after 1 hour


-----SECURITY--------
Crytography: passwords in "slogin" tables (permanent passwords) are hashed with BLOWFISH which is relatively secured(60 character hashes), hints are also hashed. 
Didn't do this for "login" tables because they are required for first time logins and for that matter, Admin has to distribute them.
-put in effort to prevent vulnerabilities (sql/code injections etc)
-randomness of usernames was designed to provide security in someway.ie. difficult to guess and confidentiality of username provides security
-password bruteforce is partially impractical because there is a 3 seconds delay in the login section.

Note: password can be bruteforced with large number of resources and time


----NOTES----
-author take no responsibility for failure of software
-Parts of code might be crapy,clumsy or unprofessional and I'm ready for corrections and constructive critcisms


---BUGS----
-known minor and unharmful bug in the user password change section 
-known minor bugs in custom dialogs (inaccurate lengths of buttons and boxes )
